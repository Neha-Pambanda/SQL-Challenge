# SQL Challenge 1 - Steve's Car Showroom

This repository contains my solution to SQL Challenge 1 - Steve's Car Showroom, a coding challenge created by @Steel Data and @Matthew Steel. The challenge focuses on designing and implementing a SQL database for a fictional car showroom owned by Steve.

In this challenge, I leveraged my SQL knowledge and skills to create a robust database schema that effectively models the car showroom's data requirements. I started by analyzing the given specifications and identified the necessary entities and their relationships.

The database schema consists of multiple tables, including "Cars," "Customers," "Sales," and "Employees," each capturing essential information about the car showroom's operations. I carefully designed the relationships between these tables, ensuring data integrity and efficient query execution.

To demonstrate my understanding of SQL, I utilized various SQL statements to populate the tables with sample data and perform complex queries. These queries showcase my ability to extract meaningful insights from the database, such as finding the most popular car model, calculating the total sales revenue, or retrieving customer details for targeted marketing campaigns.

Throughout the challenge, I strived to write clean and well-structured SQL code, adhering to best practices and ensuring readability. I also paid close attention to optimizing query performance, employing appropriate indexing strategies and query optimizations wherever necessary.

By completing this SQL Challenge, I have strengthened my database design and SQL querying skills, demonstrating my ability to solve real-world problems using SQL. I invite you to explore my solution and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you would like to discuss the implementation in further detail.

Happy coding!
